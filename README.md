# FileUtilities
FileUtilities ChatTriggers Module

```js
import FileUtilities from "../FileUtilities/main";;
```
This module provides extra utilities for files and directories not in the `FileLib` method. This includes the features of my module GZipper. The rename functions can also be used to move files/directories. All methods made before the `FileUtilities` class was implemented in 2.0.0 will remain available for use as before. For information on the functions look at main.js
